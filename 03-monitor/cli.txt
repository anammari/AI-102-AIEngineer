Now you can use the following command to get the list of cognitive services keys, 
replacing <resourceName> with the name of your cognitive services resource, 
and <resourceGroup> with the name of the resource group in which you created it.

az cognitiveservices account keys list --name ahm-amm-gntv-srv --resource-group ai102-res-grp

(ai102) root@1c99adbe42a5:/workspace/github/AI-102-AIEngineer/03-monitor# az cognitiveservices account keys list --name ahm-amm-gntv-srv --resource-group ai102-res-grp
{
  "key1": "08a4207c02414d6a9aae0cdebe82bd19",
  "key2": "4dda46052f154f6e866278e9acffd54a"
}

To generate some requests to your cognitive service, you will use curl - a command line tool for HTTP requests. In Visual Studio Code, in the 03-monitor folder, open rest-test.cmd and edit the curl command it contains (shown below), replacing <yourEndpoint> and <yourKey> with your endpoint URI and Key1 key to use the Text Analytics API in your cognitive services resource.

curl -X POST "https://ahm-amm-gntv-srv.cognitiveservices.azure.com/text/analytics/v3.1/languages?" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key: 08a4207c02414d6a9aae0cdebe82bd19" --data-ascii "{'documents':           [{'id':1,'text':'hello'}]}"
